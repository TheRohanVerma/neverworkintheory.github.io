    If you are a software developer who wants to evaluate a program repair, analysis or testing technique, but cannot find a good dataset, then let me introduce you to BugSwarm. 
	Tomassi et al.[2019] presented the BugSwarm toolset, along with a dataset of 3091 fault-fix pairs for Java and Python, which can be used for evaluation of software testing, fault detection and repair methods. 
	They also analyzed the feasibility of creating datasets with fault-fix pairs and found that due to errors like invalid URL, Assertion error and failure to install dependencies, only 5.56% of fault-fix pairs are reproducible. 
	BugSwarm extracts data from Travis-CI, a Continuous Integration service for Github, therefore, it will continuously grow, will have reproducible fault-fix pairs, indicate real-world fixes to code, and will be diverse. Moreover, the BugSwarm dataset can potentially be extended to all 900k Travis-CI supported projects on Github. 
	While authors continue to mine and reproduce additional pairs, I think that BugSwarm is a good dataset that will reduce the time and effort required to evaluate program analysis and testing methodologies while also encouraging new research and large-scale software studies.
